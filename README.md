# Next.js 15 Server Component Hydration Issues

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15 related to hydration errors when using server components with complex dependency structures.  Specifically, deeply nested or circular dependencies can lead to runtime errors during the hydration process, resulting in vague error messages that are difficult to debug.

## Problem

When server components have circular dependencies or overly complex nested imports, Next.js may fail to properly resolve these dependencies.  This leads to hydration mismatches or missing module errors.  The exact error message is often unhelpful in pinpointing the root cause.

## Solution

The solution involves refactoring the code to avoid circular dependencies and simplify the import structure.  Consider using techniques like code splitting and restructuring the component hierarchy to improve maintainability and address potential issues during the server component resolution phase.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the hydration error in the browser's developer console.
